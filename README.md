# Laravel Sail Extended

This repository accompanies the following blog post: [You don't need Laravel Sail](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/you-dont-need-laravel-sail "You don't need Laravel Sail").

It shows how to extend [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail) in three different ways:

* by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file;
* by updating the application's Dockerfile;
* by adding a custom `sail` script at the root of the project to extend the existing one.

The post argues that once you know how to extend Laravel Sail using these methods, there is no reason not to build your own Docker-based development environment instead.

Please refer to the [full version](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/you-dont-need-laravel-sail "You don't need Laravel Sail") for a complete explanation.
